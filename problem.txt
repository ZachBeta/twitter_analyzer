Write a library that sorts and prints the words in a given twitter user’s last 1000
tweets sorted by frequency of use.

For example, if jack had tweeted:
“hello world”
“hello everyone, and world”
“hi world”

The result could be:
world
hello
and
hi
everyone

Feel free to do this in any language, but if you’re comfortable in Ruby, Python,
Javascript, Java or Scala those are easier for us. Send us a link to a git repo or a
tarball of your code. Make sure to include a sample invocation somewhere in your
response.
